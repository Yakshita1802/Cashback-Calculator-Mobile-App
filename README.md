## The following screenshots show the working of the application

1.	The **WelcomeScreen** component is a React Native page with a background image and stylized elements, providing a welcoming interface for a cashback calculator app. It includes a title, subtitle, description, and buttons for user login and signup, all styled for an engaging and intuitive user experience.

 



2.	The SignupScreen component in React Native handles user registration, capturing details like name, email, password, and date of birth. It uses Firebase authentication and Firestore to store user data, including sending a verification email, and provides a user-friendly form for signup with error handling.

 
3.	The LoginScreen component in React Native handles user login, including authentication using Firebase, fetching user data from Firestore based on the login credentials, and providing options for password reset. It integrates with navigation and updates the Wallet screen with user-specific data upon successful login.

 
4.	The Wallet component in React Native displays the user's wallet information, including a list of stored cards, available credit balance, and provides options for adding new cards, navigating to card details, and accessing additional features through icon buttons at the bottom. It integrates with Firebase Firestore for data retrieval and navigation between screens.

 
5.	The CardIssuerSelector React Native component allows users to select a card issuer from a list fetched from Realtime Firebase. It includes a search bar for filtering issuers, and upon selection, it navigates to the 'AddCard' screen with the chosen issuer and the user's UID.

 

6.	The AddCard React Native component enables users to select and add cards to their wallet. It fetches card data from Realtime Firebase, allows card selection with a checkbox, and adds selected cards to the user's Firestore-based wallet upon confirmation. The component includes a search bar for card filtering and displays card details, including images.

 
7.	The CardDetails React Native component displays detailed information about a specific card fetched from Realtime Firebase, including its name, issuer, rewards percentages for various categories, and an optional image. The component uses a ScrollView for vertical scrolling and presents the details in a visually organized layout.

 
8.	The Category React Native component fetches card categories from Realtime Firebase, allowing users to select a category. It then displays the top percentage cards in that category, providing users with information on the cards and allowing them to navigate to a rewards calculation screen for a selected card within the chosen category. The component utilizes FlatList for rendering categories and top percentage cards in a visually organized layout.

 

9.	The RewardsCalculation React Native component allows users to input the amount spent and percentage to calculate rewards. Users can save the calculated reward, updating both the user's overall reward balance and saving the reward amount in a subcollection within their wallet in Firestore. The component provides a straightforward interface for reward calculation and saving.
